**Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<!-- Write about how you built the project here. Include your work with the API. -->


## Lessons Learned:
Some of the things I learned while building this project include:
- How confusing large functions can get. Some of my functions are 40-50 lines long and include logic for several different things. This got overwhleming at times, and if I were to optimize the code better, I'd make a lot of smaller functions just to break it all up and make it more easily comprehendable.
- How to work with a third-party API. This API was pretty easy to use as the documentation was pretty good. But there was still a lot of console.logging my actual return values so as to retrieve the correct thing.
